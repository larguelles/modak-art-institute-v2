# Modak Art Institute v2
**Why v2?**

I had applied to Modak in the past and had to solve the same challenge. This time around, I focused on maintaining but improving on top of the UI I had already built, and starting from scratch in terms of state management and api calls.

**How to run**
1. Clone the project. 
2. yarn install
3. npx pod-install 
4. npx react-native run-ios

**What has changed between v1 and v2?**

v1's state management and api calls were built using redux, redux thunk, redux persist and axios. This time I kept axios but built a much smarter, readable and modern state management solution using Zustand. 
I have added an easter egg to the application which I intended to crown with push notifications, but since my development laptop is currently being repaired and I have a large workload ahead of myself this week, I decided to stop here. 

**Two contributors**

You may notice there's two contributors in this project, both are different accounts of mine, I didn't check which one I was using when originally building this project in a gitlab repo, and then migrating it over to github.
